;;; Hoist LOAD-TIME-VALUE-ASTs.

;;; An occurrence of a LOAD-TIME-VALUE-AST is replaced by a freshly
;;; created LEXICAL-AST.  We also create a fresh SETQ-AST that
;;; contains the contents of the FORM-AST slot of the original
;;; LOAD-TIME-VALUE-AST as the VALUE-AST and the freshly created
;;; LEXICAL-AST as the LHS-AST.
;;;
;;; Finally, a PROGN-AST is created that contains all the freshly
;;; created SETQ-ASTs as its first forms and the original AST as its
;;; last form.
