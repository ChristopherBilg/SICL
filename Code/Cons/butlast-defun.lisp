;;; The HyperSpec doesn't specify what happens if n is 0.  There is a
;;; note that says:
;;;
;;;     (butlast list n) ==  (ldiff list (last list n))
;;;
;;; but notes are not normative.  If you do believe this note, then
;;; (butlast '(1 2 3 . 4) 0) should return (1 2 3), i.e., it doesn't
;;; return the unmodified list.
;;;
;;; This implementation works according to the HyperSpec note when n
;;; is 0.
