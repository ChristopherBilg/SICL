;;; It used to be the case that the append function was defined in

;;; implementations have buggy versions of (loop ... nconc ...)  so it
;;; is better to just define it in terms of a lower-level construct.
;;; Doing it this way allows for implementations with a buggy loop to
;;; still use this module without first replacing loop by ours.
