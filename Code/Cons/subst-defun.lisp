;;; We do not provide special versions for when the key is identity and
;;; the test-not is either eq or eql.  Here is why:
;;;
;;; Let's start with eq, and let's suppose the old item is an atom.
;;; Then either the old item is eq to the tree or not eq to the tree.
;;; If the old item is eq to the tree, then the tree too is an atom,
;;; and it is returned, because no substitutions are made, and we
;;; reached a leaf of the tree.  If the old item is not eq to the
;;; tree, then we make a substitution and return the new item.  In
;;; other words, this operation is the same as:
;;; (if (eq old-item tree) old-item new-item)
;;;
;;; Now suppose the old item is not an atom, and thus a cons.  Then
;;; the old item is either eq to the tree or not.  If the old item is
;;; not eq to the tree, then we return the new item and stop.  If the
;;; old item is eq to the tree, consider the two immediate subtrees
;;; (car and cdr) of the tree.  If none of them is eq to the the old
;;; item, then we return a cons where the car and cdr both contain the
;;; new item.  Now let's say that the car of the tree is eq to the old
;;; item.  Then it is also eq to the tree itself (beacuase we are
;;; handling the case where the old item and the tree are eq).  Then
;;; we have a circular structure, and it is undefined (the Hyperspec
;;; actually doesn't say that, but the Notes on the relevant page
;;; suggest it) what happens.  It is therefore very unlikely that
;;; someone would use this special case, so we have decided not to
;;; include it.
;;;
;;; A similar argument can be made for eql. 

;;; While it is possible that a test-not of eq or eql could be useful
;;; in combination with a key argument that is not identity, we do not
;;; think that case is very common either, so we omit it too.
