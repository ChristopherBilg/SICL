;;; Function MACROEXPAND-1.
;;;
;;; This function returns two values, the expanded form and a boolean
;;; indicating whether the form was expanded or not.  I can't think of
;;; a reason for the existence of the second return value, because if
;;; the form is a macro form, then the expander is called and the
;;; second value is true.  If the form is not a macro form, then the
;;; initial form is return and the second value is false.  If the
;;; expander should ever return the same form, then MACROEXPAND-1 will
;;; be called again (at least if it was called by MACROEXPAND) and we
;;; would have an infinite computation.  Though I suppose that if the
;;; expander did some non-functional stuff like consulting global
;;; variables, then, it might be possible.
