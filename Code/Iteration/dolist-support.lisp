;;; Macro DOLIST.
;;;
;;; The spec says that the variable is bound to nil when the
;;; result-form is evaluated.  But we don't want the declarations to
;;; have to include nil as one of the values of var.  For that reason,
;;; there needs to be a different binding of the variable when the
;;; forms of the body are evaluated and when the result-form is
;;; evaluated.
;;;
;;; The spec says we have a choice between binding or assigning the
;;; variable in each iteration.  For dolist, choosing assignment gets
;;; complicated in the first iteration though, because we would have
;;; to come up with an initial value of the variable that is
;;; compatible with the declarations.  For that reason, we choose to
;;; bind it.
