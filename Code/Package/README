There is a lot to be done in this directory:

 * There are several FIXME comments in the files in this directory.
   They should be taken care of accordingly.

 * Calls to ERROR should have restarts whenever there is a reasonable
   action to take in such a restart.  For example the error that
   signals NOT-A-PACKAGE-DESIGNATOR should have a restart for
   supplying a valid package designator.
