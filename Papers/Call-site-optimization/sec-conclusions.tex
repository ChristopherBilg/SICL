\section{Conclusions and future work}

We have presented a very general technique for call-site optimization.
Our technique subsumes (entirely or partially) several other
techniques such as inlining, compiler macros, sealing.

Our technique is very general, and promises several advantages to
function-call performance that can not easily be obtained with other
techniques.  The flip side is that our technique is fairly complicated
and requires significant support from both the compiler and the memory
manager.

Furthermore, we have not implemented the suggested technique, and the
state of the \sicl{} system is not yet such that it can be done soon.
The most urgent future work, then, is to create a native \sicl{}
executable.  We are probably several months away before this work can
be accomplished.
