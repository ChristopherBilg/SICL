\section{Disadvantages of our technique}

The proposed technique is fairly complicated.  In order for all the
advantages to be had, the callee must be represented in such a way
that multiple versions can be created, depending on different
information provided by each callee.  On the other hand, most of the
benefit of this technique can be obtained with a limited amount of
such flexibility.  Bypassing argument parsing in the presence of
optional or keyword parameters will already provide great benefits.

The garbage collector must not reclaim snippets that are currently in
use, and ``in use'' can mean that a callee has an activation record on
the call stack, so that the snippet can not be reclaimed until the
activation record is removed from the stack.  This requirement will
require a modification to the garbage collector, and code for garbage
collectors is notoriously hard to get right.
