\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-introduction}

Function calls in a dynamic language like \commonlisp{} can be
significantly more expensive in terms of processor cycles than
function calls in a typical static language.  There are several
reasons for this additional cost:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Functions can be removed or redefined at run-time, and callers
  must take such updates into account, requiring some indirection that
  can be modified at run-time.
\item \commonlisp{} has a rich function-call protocol with optional
  parameters and keyword parameters.  Keyword parameters, in
  particular, require some considerable parsing for every
  call to a function that has such parameters.
\item In general, a function that can only honor its contract for
  certain types of its arguments must check such types for each call.
\item All objects must be \emph{boxed} in order to be used as function
  arguments.  In particular, IEEE double-float values will typically
  have to be allocated on the heap, though so-called NaN-boxing%
  \footnote{Add a reference} can
  eliminate that particular case.  Full-word integers still require
  boxing, however.
\item Generic functions can be dynamically updated by the addition or
  removal of methods.
\end{enumerate}

In a typical \commonlisp{} implementation, item number 1 is handled by
an indirection in the form of a slot in the symbol naming the
function, requiring a memory access.  On modern processors a memory
access can be significantly more costly than, say, a register
operation.

Item number 2 can be mitigated by the use of compiler macros.
Essentially, the creator of a function with a non-trivial lambda list
can also create special versions of this function for various argument
lists.  A call with an argument list that is recognized by the
compiler macro can then be replaced by a call to such a special
version, presumably with a simpler lambda list.

Item number 3 can be handled by inlining, allowing the compiler to
take advantage of type inference and type declarations to determine
that some type checks can be elided.  However, inlining has the
disadvantage that a redefinition of the callee will not automatically
be taken into account, and requiring the caller to be recompiled for
the redefinition to be effective.
