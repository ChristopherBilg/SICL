\section{Previous work}

To our knowledge, little or no work on call-site optimization has been
done in the context of \commonlisp{}.  The unique features of
\commonlisp{} such as generic functions with arbitrary method
combinations and multiple dispatch make the task very difficult.

One technique that is fairly common is \emph{inline caching},
pioneered by Smalltalk \cite{Deutsch:1984:ES}.  This technique is used
to avoid repeated method selection in a particular call site.  The key
observation is that, for a particular call site, often the same method
is concerned each time the call is made.  By caching the latest
method, keyed by the distinguished class argument, a costlier
computation can often be avoided.  This technique requires a cache
stored in memory, and memory accesses can be very costly on modern
processors.
