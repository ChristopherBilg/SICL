\section{Conclusions and future work}

We have defined a \clos{}-based protocol for lexical environments.
This protocol can be used by any code walker such as a compiler or a
version of \texttt{macroexpand-all}.  Compared to the protocol defined
in CLtL2 \cite{Steele:1990:CLL:95411}, ours is complete in that it has
operators for querying an environment for references to tags and
blocks, and for augmenting environments with such entities.

Furthermore, our protocol is implemented in the \trucler{} library.
\trucler{} supplies implementations for some existing \commonlisp{}
implementations, currently \sbcl{} and \ccl{}.  The library also
contains a \emph{reference implementation} that can be used in new
\commonlisp{} implementations that do not have an existing native
representation of lexical environments, such as \sicl{} and \clasp{}.
