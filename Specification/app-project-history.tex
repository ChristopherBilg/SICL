\chapter{Project history}

The project was launched by Robert Strandh in the second half of 2008.
The first modules being worked on were \texttt{format} and the module
containing functions and macros for \texttt{cons} cells.  Not much
work was accomplished in 2009.

In March of 2010, worked was picked up again.  The \texttt{cons}
module was improved.  A module containing documentation strings for
standard operators was created.  The \texttt{array} module was also
created.
