\chapter{Bootstrapping}

\section{General technique}

\sysname{} is bootstrapped from an existing \commonlisp{}
implementation that, in addition to the functionality required by the
standard, also contains the library \texttt{closer-mop}.  This
\commonlisp{} system is called the \emph{host}.  The result of the
bootstrapping process is an \emph{image} in the form of an executable
file containing a \sysname{} system.  This system is called the
\emph{target}.  We have not yet decided whether to generate a complete
target system using the host, or whether to generate a partial system
that would then load additional functionality from compiled files
\seesec{sec-bootstrapping-viable-image}.

In general, the target image can be thought of as containing
\emph{graph} of \commonlisp{} objects that have been placed in memory
according to the spaces managed by the memory manager.  To create this
graph, we first generate an \emph{isomorphic} graph of host objects in
the memory of an executing host system.  To generate the target image,
the isomorphic host graph is traversed, creating a target version of
each object in the host graph, and placing that object on an
appropriate address in the target image.

The isomorphic host graph contains objects that are \emph{analogous}
to their target counterparts as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A target \texttt{fixnum} is represented as a host integer.
  Whether the integer is a host fixnum or not depends on the fixnum
  range of the host.
\item A target \texttt{character} is represented as a host character.
\item A target \texttt{cons} cell is represented as a host
  \texttt{cons} cell.
\item A target \texttt{symbol} is represented as a host symbol.
\item A target standard object is represented as a host
  \texttt{standard-object} for the \emph{header} and a host
  \texttt{simple-vector} for the \emph{rack}.
\item Target objects such as bignums or floats are not needed at this
  stage of bootstrapping, so they do not have any representation as
  host objects.
\end{itemize}

\section{Global environments for bootstrapping}

During different phases of bootstrapping, a particular \emph{name} (of
a function, class, etc) must be associated with different objects.  As
a trivial example, the function \texttt{allocate-object} in the host
system is used to allocate all standard objects.  But
\texttt{allocate-object} is also a target function for allocating
objects according to the way such objects are represented by the
target system.  These two functions must be available simultaneously.

Most systems solve this problem by using temporary names for target
packages during the bootstrapping process.  For example, even though
in the final target system, the name \texttt{allocate-object} must be
a symbol in the \texttt{common-lisp} package, during the bootstrapping
process, the name might be a symbol in a package with a different
name.

In \sysname{} we solve the problem by using multiple \emph{first-class
  global environments}, provided by the library Clostrum as describe
in \refChap{chap-first-class-global-environments}.

For the purpose of bootstrapping, it is convenient to think of
\texttt{eval} as consisting of two distinct operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Compile.  A \emph{compilation environment} is used to expand
  macros and for other compilation purposes.  The result of
  compilation is code that is \emph{untied} to any particular
  environment.
\item Tie.  The untied code produced by the first step is \emph{tied}
  to a particular run-time environment.  Tying is accomplished by
  calling the top-level function created by the compilation.  This
  function takes a single argument, namely a ``function-cell finder''
  function.  Calling that argument function with a function name,
  returns a function cell in a particular environment, thereby tying
  the code to that particular environment.
\end{itemize}

The reason we need to separate these two operations is that for
bootstrapping purposes, the two are going to use distinct global
environments.

\section{Viable image}
\label{sec-bootstrapping-viable-image}

An image I is said to be \emph{viable} if and only if it is possible
to obtain a complete \commonlisp{} system by starting with I and loading a
sequence of ordinary compiled files.

\section{Bootstrapping phases}

\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{simple instance} is an instance of some class, but that is
also neither a class nor a generic function.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{host class} is a class in the host system.  If it is an
instance of the host class \texttt{standard-class}, then it is
typically created by the host macro \texttt{defclass}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{host instance} is an instance of a host class.  If it is an
instance of the host class \texttt{standard-object}, then it is
typically created by a call to the host function
\texttt{make-instance} using a host class or the name of a host class.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{host generic function} is a generic function created by the
host macro \texttt{defgeneric}, so it is a host instance of the host
class \texttt{generic-function}.  Arguments to the discriminating
function of such a generic function are host instances.  The host
function \texttt{class-of} is called on some required arguments in
order to determine what methods to call.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{host method} is a method created by the host macro
\texttt{defmethod}, so it is a host instance of the host class
\texttt{method}.  The class specializers of such a method are host
classes.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{simple host instance} is a host instance that is neither a
host class nor a host generic function.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{ersatz instance} is a target instance represented as a host
data structure, using a host standard object to represent the
\emph{header} and a host simple vector to represent the \emph{rack}.
In fact, the header is an instance of the host class
\texttt{funcallable-standard-object} so that some ersatz instances can
be used as functions in the host system.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An ersatz instance is said to be \emph{pure} if the class slot of the
header is also an ersatz instance.  An ersatz instance is said to be
\emph{impure} if it is not pure.  See below for more information on
impure ersatz instances.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{ersatz class} is an ersatz instance that can be instantiated
to obtain another ersatz instance.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{ersatz generic function} is an ersatz instance that is also a
generic function.  It is possible for an ersatz generic function be
executed in the host system because the header object is an instance
of the host class \texttt{funcallable-standard-object}.  The methods
on an ersatz generic function are ersatz methods.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
An \emph{ersatz method} is an ersatz instance that is also a method.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{bridge class} is a representation of a target class as a
simple host instance.  An impure ersatz instance has a bridge class in
the class slot of its header.  A bridge class can be instantiated to
obtain an impure ersatz instance.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{bridge generic function} is a target generic function
represented as a simple host instance, though it is an instance of the
host function \texttt{funcallable-standard-object} so it can be
executed by the host.

Arguments to a bridge generic function are ersatz instances.  The
bridge generic function uses the 
\emph{stamp}
\seesec{sec-generic-function-dispatch-the-discriminating-function} of
the required arguments to dispatch on. 

The methods on a bridge generic function are bridge methods.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{bridge method} is a target method represented by a simple host
instance.  The class specializers of such a method are bridge classes.
The \emph{method function} of a bridge method is an ordinary host
function.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Preparation}

In addition to the host environment, six different \sysname{}
first-class environments are involved in the bootstrapping procedure.
We shall refer to them as $E_0$, $E_1$, $E_2$, $E_3$, $E_4$, and $E_5$.

\subsection{Phase 0}

In phase $0$, we load enough functionality into environment $E0$ to be
able to compile source files into \emph{fasl} files.  This
functionality involves mainly standard macros that are required during
compilation.

We then compile all the files that are ultimately used in the final
system.  Since \emph{fasl} files are independent of any particular
environment, the same \emph{fasl} file can be loaded into different
environments during the following phases of stage 1.

Any code can be compiled, provided that the macros that are called by
the code are defined in environment $E_0$.  In particular, code that
defines macros can be compiled into \texttt{fasl}s.

\subsection{Phase 1}

We define a class named
\texttt{sicl-boot-phase-1:funcallable-standard-class} in the host
environment.  It is defined as a direct subclass of the host class
\texttt{closer-mop:funcallable-standard-class}.  When we
evaluate \texttt{defclass} forms in phase 2, the classes created are
instances of this class.  We could have chosen this class only for
instances that need to be executable in the host, and a subclass of
the host class \texttt{standard-class} for the others, but the host
class \texttt{funcallable-standard-class} can do everything that the
host class named \texttt{standard-class} can, so we simplify the code by
using one single class.

We define an \texttt{:around} method on \texttt{initialize-instance}
in the host environment, specialized to
\texttt{sicl-boot-phase-1:funcallable-standard-class}.  The purpose of
this \texttt{:around} method is to remove the \texttt{:reader} and
\texttt{:accessor} slot options supplied in the \texttt{defclass}
forms that we evaluate in phase 1.  Without this \texttt{:around}
method, the host function \texttt{initialize-instance} would receive
keyword arguments \texttt{:readers} and \texttt{:writers} and it would
then add methods to host generic functions corresponding to the names
given.  Instead, this \texttt{:around} method adds the readers and
writers to the generic function with the corresponding name in
envirnoment $E_3$.  It assumes that this generic function exists, so
we must create it explicitly before a class that defines the accessor
method can be defined.

In environment $E_1$, we define the following classes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{t}.  This class is the same as the host class
  \texttt{t}.  It will be used as a specializer on method arguments
  that are not otherwise specialized.
\item \texttt{common-lisp:standard-generic-function}.  This class is
  the same as the class with the same name in the host environment.
  It will be used to create host generic functions in environment
  $E_2$.
\item \texttt{common-lisp:standard-method}.  This class is
  the same as the class with the same name in the host environment.
  This class will be used to create methods on the generic functions
  that we create in environment $E_3$.
\item \texttt{common-lisp:standard-class}.  This class is the same as
  the class named
  \texttt{sicl-boot-phase-1:funcallable-standard-class} in the host
  environment.  It will be used to create most classes in $E_2$.
\item \texttt{common-lisp:built-in-class}.  This class is the same as
  the class named
  \texttt{sicl-boot-phase-1:funcallable-standard-class} in the host
  environment.  It will be used to create some classes in $E_2$, for
  example \texttt{t} and \texttt{function}.
\item \texttt{sicl-clos:funcallable-standard-class}.  This class is
  the same as the class named
  \texttt{sicl-boot-phase-1:funcallable-standard-class} in the host
  environment.  It will be used to create some classes in $E_2$, such
  as \texttt{generic-function} and \texttt{standard-generic-function}.
\item \texttt{sicl-clos:standard-direct-slot-definition}.  This class
  is the same as the class named
  \texttt{closer-mop:standard-direct-slot-definition} in the host
  environment.  This class will be used to create slot-definition
  metaobjects for the classes that we create in environment $E_2$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 2}

The purpose of phase~2 is:

\begin{itemize}
\item to create host generic functions in $E_3$ corresponding to all
  the accessor functions defined by \sysname{} on standard MOP
  classes, and
\item to create a hierarchy in $E_2$ of host standard classes that has
  the same structure as the hierarchy of MOP classes.
\end{itemize}


Three different environments are involved in phase~2:

\begin{itemize}
\item Environment $E_1$ is used to find find host classes to
  instantiate.  The class named \texttt{standard-class} in $E_1$ is
  used to instantiate most of the classes in environment $E_2$, for
  example, \texttt{standard-class}, \texttt{built-in-class},
  \texttt{slot-definition}, etc.  The class named
  \texttt{built-in-class} in $E_1$ is used to create classes
  \texttt{t} and \texttt{function} as well as some non-MOP classes in
  $E_2$.  The class named \texttt{funcallable-standard-class} in $E_1$
  is used to create classes \texttt{generic-function} and
  \texttt{standard-generic-function}, also in environment $E_2$.  The
  class named \texttt{standard-direct-slot-definition} in $E_1$ is
  used to define slot-definition metaobjects for the classes in
  environment $E_2$.  Environment $E_1$ is also used to find host
  classes \texttt{standard-generic-function} and
  \texttt{standard-method} to instantiate in order to create generic
  functions in environment $E_3$ as well as methods on those generic
  functions.
\item The run-time environment $E_2$ is where instances of the host
  classes named \texttt{standard-class},
  \texttt{funcallable-standard-class}, and \texttt{built-in-class} in
  environment $E_1$ will be associated with the names of the MOP
  hierarchy of classes.  These instances are thus host classes.  The
  entire MOP hierarchy is created as are some built-in classes such as
  \texttt{cons} and some of the number classes.
\item The run-time environment $E_3$ is where instances of the host
  class named \texttt{standard-generic-function} will be associated
  with the names of the different accessors specialized to host
  classes created in $E_2$.
\end{itemize}

One might ask at this point why generic functions are not defined in
the same environment as classes.  The simple answer is that there are
some generic functions that were automatically imported into $E_2$
from the host, that we still need in $E_2$, and that would have been
overwritten by new ones if we had defined new generic functions in
$E_2$.

Several adaptations are necessary in order to accomplish phase~2:

\begin{itemize}
\item A special version of the function
  \texttt{ensure-generic-function} is defined in environment $E_3$.
  It checks whether there is already a function with the name passed
  as an argument in $E_3$, and if so, it returns that function.  It
  makes no verification that such an existing function is really a
  generic function; it assumes that it is.  It also assumes that the
  parameters of that generic function correspond to the arguments of
  \texttt{ensure-generic-function}.  If there is no generic function
  with the name passed as an argument in $E_3$, it creates an instance
  of the host class \texttt{standard-generic-function} and associate
  it with the name in $E_3$.  To create such an instance, it calls the
  host function \texttt{make-instance}.
\item The function \texttt{ensure-class} has a special version in
  $E_2$.  Rather than checking for an existing class, it always
  creates a new one.
\end{itemize}

Phase~2 is divided into two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, the \texttt{defgeneric} forms corresponding to the
  accessors of the classes of the MOP hierarchy are evaluated using
  $E_2$ as both the compilation environment and run-time environment.
  The result of this step is a set of host generic functions in $E_3$,
  each having no methods.
\item Next, the \texttt{defclass} forms corresponding to the classes
  of the MOP hierarchy are evaluated using $E_2$ as both the
  compilation environment and run-time environment.  The result of
  this step is a set of host classes in $E_2$ and host standard
  methods on the accessor generic functions created in step~1
  specialized to these classes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Phase 3}

The purpose of phase~3 is to create a hierarchy of bridge classes that
has the same structure as the hierarchy of MOP classes.

Three different environments are involved in phase~3:

\begin{itemize}
\item The run-time environment $E_2$ is used to look up metaclasses to
  instantiate in order to create the bridge classes.
\item The run-time environment $E_3$ is the one in which bridge
  classes will be associated with names.
\item The run-time environment $E_4$ is the one in which bridge
  generic functions will be associated with names.
\end{itemize}

We start by creating generic functions corresponding to all slot
accessors that are defined in the MOP hierarchy.  We then create
bridge classes corresponding to the classes of the MOP hierarchy.
When a bridge class is created, it will automatically create bridge
methods on the bridge generic functions corresponding to slot readers
and writers.

Creating bridge classes this way will also instantiate the host class
\texttt{target:direct-slot-definition}.

In this phase, we also prepare for the creation of ersatz instances.

\subsection{Phase 4}

The purpose of this phase is to create ersatz generic functions and
ersatz classes, by instantiating bridge classes.  

At the end of this phase, we have a set of ersatz instances, some of
which are ersatz classes, except that the \texttt{class} slot of the
header object of every such instance is a bridge class.  We call such
ersatz instances \emph{impure}.  We also have a set of ersatz generic
functions (mainly accessors) that are ersatz instances like all the
others.

\subsection{Phase 5}

The first step of this phase is to finalize all the ersatz classes
that were created in phase 4.  Finalization will create ersatz
instances of bridge classes corresponding to effective slot
definitions. 

The second step repeats the creation of MOP generic functions and MOP
classes, this time in environments $E_6$ and $E_5$ respectively.  As
opposed to the objects created in phase~4, the objects created in this
phase are \emph{pure} ersatz objects, in that the class slot of the
header object is also an ersatz object, albeit impure.

\subsection{Phase 6}

\subsection{Phase 7}

The purpose of this phase is to create ersatz instances for all
objects that are needed in order to obtain a viable image, including: 

\begin{itemize}
\item ersatz built-in classes such as \texttt{package}, \texttt{symbol},
  \texttt{string}, etc., 
\item ersatz instances of those classes, such as the required
  packages, the symbols contained in those packages, the names of
  those symbols, etc.
\item ersatz standard classes for representing the global environment
  and its contents.
\item ersatz instances of those classes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 8}

The purpose of this phase is to replace all the host instances that
have been used so far as part of the entire ersatz structure, such as
symbols, lists, and integers by their ersatz counterparts.

\subsection{Phase 9}

The purpose of this phase is to take the simulated graph of objects
used so far and transfer it to a \emph{memory image}.  

\subsection{Phase 10}

Finally, the memory image is written to a binary file.
