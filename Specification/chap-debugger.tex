\chapter{Debugger}
\label{chap-debugger}

Part of the reason for \sysname{} is to have a system that provides
excellent debugging facilities for the programmer.  The kind of
debugger we plan to support is described in a separate repository.%
\footnote{See https://github.com/robert-strandh/Clordane}  In this
chapter, we describe only the support that \sysname{} contains in
order to make such a debugger possible.

Each function contains two versions of the code, called the
\emph{normal} version and the \emph{debugging} version.%
\footnote{This idea was suggested by Michael Raskin.}
Calls from a normal version of a caller are made to the normal version
of callees, and calls from a debugging version of a caller are made to
the debugging version of callees.

The normal version is used when the thread is not run under the
control of the debugger, so this version does not contain any code for
communicating with the debugger.  Furthermore, this version is highly
optimized.  In particular, variables that occur in the source code may
have been eliminated by various optimization passes.

The debugging version starts by examining a special variable that
contains information about the current thread.  In particular, this
information includes a table in the form of a bit vector containing
summary information about breakpoints.  In this version of the
function body the compiler inserts a call to a small subroutine before
and after every form to be evaluated.  The subroutine does not use the
full \commonlisp{} function-call protocol.  Instead, it is just a very
fast call that can be done with a \texttt{jsr} instruction (or
equivalent) on must architectures.

The subroutine does a test in two steps.  In the first step, the value
of the program counter is taken modulo some reasonably large value
such as 256, and a the bit vector is queried to see whether the
corresponding entry is a 1.  If it is 0, the subroutine simply
returns.  This first step will slow down every debugged thread a
little bit, but most of the time, the value will be 0, and then,
normal function execution is resumed.

If the entry in the bit vector turns out to be 1, then the final test
is made.  The program counter is checked against a hash table in the
thread instance to see whether some action must be taken.  If so, the
thread gives up control to the debugger.

The debugging version does not have optimizations applied to it that
may make debugging harder.  Lexical variables that appear in source
code may be kept, or code may be included that can compute their
values from the lexical variables that \emph{are} kept, for the
duration of their scope.

%% For each possible breakpoint, the system must keep a description of
%% the lexical environment.  This includes mappings from variable names
%% to registers or stack locations, information about liveness of
%% registers and stack location, how a variable is stored in a location
%% (immediate value, pointer, with or without type tag, etc).
