\chapter{Tying a code object}
\label{chap-tying-a-code-object}

As explained in \refChap{chap-compiler}, the compiler produces a code
object \seesec{data-representation-code-objects} that is
\emph{untied}, meaning that it is independent of any particular global
environment.  In this chapter, we describe how an untied code object
is tied to a particular global environment, as well as the difference
between an untied and a tied code object.
