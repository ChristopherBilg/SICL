\frame{
\frametitle{Motivation}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Dissatisfaction with the way current \commonlisp{}
  implementations are written.
\item Duplication of system code between implementations.
\item Some such instances are justified.  Most are not.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Initial idea}
\vskip 0.25cm
Create a set of \emph{modules} that can be used to create a complete
\commonlisp{} implementation from a minimal \emph{core}.
\vskip 0.25cm
Problem: Such modules must be ordered by dependency, and each one
written in a subset defined by preceding modules, creating a
maintenance nightmare.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{New idea}
\vskip 0.25cm
Use the full \commonlisp{} language to implement each module,
including generic functions and standard classes.
\vskip 0.25cm
For it to work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Some code must be executed in a \emph{host} during
  bootstrapping.  In particular, this is the case for macro expanders
  of basic target macros.  But usually, macro expanders can be written
  as portable \commonlisp{} code.
\item Some \emph{target-specific} code must be executed in the host
  during bootstrapping.  More about this later.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Implementing CLOS}
\vskip 0.25cm
Most \commonlisp{} implementation probably use a derivative of PCL.
\vskip 0.25cm
But PCL was explicitly written to be bolted onto a pre-ANSI
\commonlisp{} system.
\vskip 0.25cm
As it turns out, CLOS is best described as the result of executing
CLOS code.
\vskip 0.25cm
So we need a way to execute \sicl{}-specific code in the host during
bootstrapping.
\vskip 0.25cm
Our solution is described in our 2019 ELS paper.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Initial modules}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{format}
\item \texttt{loop}
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.25cm
Both use generic functions and standard classes.
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Extracted modules}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Concrete Syntax Tree
\item Eclector (\texttt{read} and more)
\item Cleavir version 2
\item Clostrum (first-class global environments)
\item Trucler (lexical environments)
\item Incless (printer)
\item Inravina (pretty printer)
\item Cyclosis (streams)
\item Cluster (assembler)
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.25cm
Both use generic functions and standard classes.
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Concrete syntax tree}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Started life as a \sicl{} module.
\item Defines standard classes for wrapping S-expressions so that
  additional information can be included.
\item In particular, information about source location can be added.
\item Now, a separate repository.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Eclector}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Started life as the \sicl{} reader.
\item Need to read source into Concrete Syntax Trees.
\item For second Climacs, we also wanted to read skipped material such
  as comments and material omitted by reader macros.
\item Now, Eclector is a stable, configurable reader that is
  independent of any implementation.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Compiler framework (Cleavir)}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Creation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from a Concrete Syntax
  Tree (CST) to
\item Creation of High-level Intermediate Representation (HIR) from an
  AST.  HIR is a traditional flow graph, with the restriction that every
  variable contains a \commonlisp{} object.
\item Creation of Medium-level Intermediate Representation (MIR) from
  HIR.  MIR introduces explicit memory operations, so some objects are
  raw addresses and raw integers.
\item Creation of Low-level Intermediate Representation (LIR) from
  MIR.  LIR introduces registers, so it is backend specific.
\item Register allocation.
\item Code generation.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Clostrum}
\vskip 0.25cm
Alternative spelling for ``claustrum'' which means ``room''.
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item First-class global environments.
\item Initial protocol in our 2015 ELS paper.
\item Created for the purpose of SICL bootstrapping, so as to avoid
  package renaming (used by SBCL for instance).
\item Also meant to be an explicit feature of SICL.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Trucler}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Lexical environments.
\item CLOS version of the CLtL2 environment protocol.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Incless}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Methods on \texttt{print-object}
\item Currently trampolines to \texttt{print-object-with-client}, but
  we may need to rethink this design.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Inravina}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Pretty printer
\item Much better written and with more features that the typical
  pretty printer.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Cyclosis}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Classes and methods for streams.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Cluster, the assembler with a difference}
\vskip 0.25cm

Observation: The main task of an assembler (at least for a CISC) is to
turn abstract instructions such as ADD into machine code, depending on
the arguments.  Parsing text and producing object code in a file are
secondary tasks.
\vskip 0.25cm
What Cluster does:
\begin{itemize}
\item It takes a list of standard objects, each representing an
  instruction or a label.
\item It returns a vector of bytes that represents the machine code.
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.25cm
This way, the compiler does not have to generate text that then has to
be parsed.
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{New techniques}
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item First-class global environments.
\item Fast generic dispatch.
\item Handling \texttt{:from-end} better.
\item Macros for simplifying sequence functions.
\item Satiation (computing complete discriminating functions).
\item Garbage collector.
\item Debugging support.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Current state}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bootstrapping mostly working.
\item \texttt{eval} semantics is used during bootstrapping.  Change to
  file-compilation semantics.
\item Different external modules have different conflicting
  requirements.  Fix by using one first-class global environment per
  external module during bootstrapping.
\item Simple call-site manager still not written.
\end{itemize}

}

\frame{
\frametitle{Future work}
\vskip 0.25cm
Extract more modules into separate repositories:
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{format}
\item \texttt{loop}
\item \texttt{sequence functions}
\item \texttt{high-level list functions}
\item \texttt{hash tables?}
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Future work}
\vskip 0.25cm
(Research) Investigate the relationship between
static-single-assignment form (SSA) and global value numbering (GVN).
We think the latter might be strictly more general than the former.
\vskip 0.25cm
\begin{itemize}
\item Have the register allocator work on the result of global value
  numbering rather than on lexical locations.
\item Allow the register allocator to do rematerialization.
\item Compare with Cliff Click's ``sea of nodes'' representation.
\end{itemize}
